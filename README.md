A tool to generate a custom starter menu in PMD: Explorers of Sky. This is intended to be used alongside SkyTemple, and exists to save people from having to type out hundreds of lines of repetitive menu code.
Required special processes:
* set_frame_color.asm
* starter_setter.asm
Required skypatches:
* ExtraSpace
* ExtractSPCode
* FixPartnerNameMenu
This is currently a very rough proof of concept. Improvements to come.
